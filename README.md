Reinforcement Learning Robot with Bi-Directional Communication
Overview
This project combines robot design, reinforcement learning, and real-time communication to build an interactive system where a neural network controls a robot through a game-like environment.

The robot is programmed to replicate LED light sequences using four physical buttons. A custom reinforcement learning environment has been developed to train the agent to complete the task successfully. Communication between the robot (powered by an ESP32 microcontroller) and a Python-based training engine is fully bi-directional using WebSocket protocols.

Features
âœ… Custom-built robot design (Fusion 360 CAD)

âœ… Four-button control interface for interacting with LED sequences

âœ… Reinforcement learning environment for training the robot to reproduce sequences

âœ… Real-time, bi-directional communication between ESP32 and Python

âœ… WebSocket-based communication channel for fast and reliable signal exchange

System Architecture

Copy
Edit
[Python RL Agent]  <== WebSocket ==>  [ESP32 Microcontroller]  <==>  [Robot Hardware]
Python sends action commands to ESP32

ESP32 updates robot hardware (LEDs, buttons) and sends sensor states back to Python

Reinforcement Learning model is trained based on state-action feedback loop

Technologies Used
Python: Game engine, RL training environment

ESP32: Microcontroller handling robot hardware logic

WebSocket: Real-time, two-way communication

Fusion 360: Robot design and CAD files

Stable-Baselines3 (or your RL library): Reinforcement learning framework

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

ESP32 development environment (e.g. Arduino IDE or PlatformIO)

WebSocket Python library (websocket-client)

Run the Python Controller
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install websocket-client stable-baselines3
python controller.py
Flash ESP32 Code
Upload the ESP32 firmware via your preferred platform.
