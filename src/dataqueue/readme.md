 Step-by-Step Setup for RabbitMQ Messaging Pipeline
🧱 1. Environment Setup
 Create a docker-compose.yaml to define and orchestrate:

RL agent container (e.g., pacman)

RabbitMQ container

Redis container

Worker container

🛠 Tip: You’ve already done most of this — just make sure each service is in the same Docker network.

📨 2. Configure RabbitMQ (Messaging Layer)
 Write a rabbitMQ.Dockerfile that:

Installs RabbitMQ

Adds a user/password (pacman / pacman_pass)

Enables management plugin

 Write rabbit_init.sh to:

Add users/permissions

Set message size limits

 Mount this script in the Dockerfile and run it via CMD or entrypoint.sh

🔁 This sets up the queue (e.g. HF_upload_queue) for communicating between the RL agent and the worker.

📦 3. RL Agent: Publish Compressed Data to Redis + RabbitMQ
In your RL training script:

 Collect frames and actions

 Compress and store them in Redis using zstd

 Push the Redis key (e.g., episode_001) to RabbitMQ queue HF_upload_queue

python
Copy
Edit
self.redis_client.set("episode_001", compressed_data)
self.channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='HF_upload_queue', body='["episode_001"]')
✅ This signals the worker to fetch and upload.

👷 4. Worker: Listen to RabbitMQ, Pull from Redis, Upload to HF
In your worker/ service:

 Connect to RabbitMQ, listen to HF_upload_queue

 For each key received:

 Fetch compressed data from Redis

 Decompress and deserialize

 Convert to Hugging Face datasets.Dataset

 Push using datasets.Dataset.push_to_hub("your-username/your-dataset")

✅ This completes the upload process.

🔒 5. Environment Security (Optional)
 Use .env to store passwords

 Add retry/backoff logic in both Redis and RabbitMQ connections (already in your code ✅)

🧪 6. Test the End-to-End Flow
 Run docker-compose up --build

 Monitor:

RL logs (pacman)

Queue in RabbitMQ (check http://localhost:15672)

Redis keys

Worker logs

 Confirm Hugging Face dataset was created or updated

📄 7. Document Your Pipeline
 Write a README.md explaining:

Service roles

Communication flow

How to train + collect + upload

 Optionally draw a diagram (like the one you posted earlier)

            [Worker]
                 |
        +--> Redis (pull data)
        +--> Hugging Face Hub make above list into md and also add in more if necessary
